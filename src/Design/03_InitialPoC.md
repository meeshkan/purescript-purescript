# Initial PoC

This small sketch contains several ideas that will need to come together for this to work:

- Translating ADT constructors to `data` and ADT types to `kind`
- Case logic
- FFI
- Functions
- Exported vs internal
- Eval

The goal is for all evaluatable top-level functions to be evaluated.
